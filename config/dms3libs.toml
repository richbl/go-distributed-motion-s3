  # the Motion application is currently used for motion detection and is configured differently
  # based on the version of Motion (or MotionPlus) installed on the client, and the client OS in
  # use
  #
  # When in doubt, consult the Motion documentation: https://motion-project.github.io/
  #
  # As an example, Motion 4.7.x running on a Raspberry Pi with the Bookworm (or later) OS requires
  # special configuration and the command to start Motion is "libcamerify motion"
  #
  # MOTION = "/usr/bin/libcamerify motion"
  # 
  # In the configuration below, the MotionPlus application is used, and in a current release
  # (0.2.2), the command to include its configuration file is required when running the dms3client
  # as a system service
  #
  MOTION = "/usr/local/bin/motionplus -c /usr/local/etc/motionplus/motionplus.conf"
