  # dashboard server will report a device caution status (yellow device icon) after 3000
  # seconds (50 minutes) if no status updates received from that device
  #
  # Device status will continue to progress through each of the stages identified below, or reset
  # to a normal device status if device again reports in to the dashboard server
