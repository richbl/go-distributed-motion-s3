  # dashboard server will report a device caution status (yellow device icon) after 1500
  # seconds (25 minutes) of no status updates received from that device
  #
  # Device status will continue to progress through each of the stages identified below, or reset
  # to a normal device status if device again reports in to the dashboard server
